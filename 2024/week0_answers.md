**ðŸ¤” Consider the following:**
1. What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?

Zero-Knowledge Proofs is a mechanism where an entity can cryptographically proof a statement to another withour reveling anything about that statement.

2. What are the principles of soundness, completeness, and zero-knowledge?

Soundness: The prover can't cheat the verify if the statement is not valid.
Completeness: An honest prover will eventually convince the verify about the validity of the statment.
ZK: The verifier learns nothing about the statement besides the fact it's true.

3. What distinguishes interactive from non-interactive proofs?

While in interactive proofs we need a back a forth communication between the prover and the verifier, in non-interactive proofs the verifier can convince itself about the validity of the statement.
