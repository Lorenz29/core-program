**ðŸ¤” Consider the following:**
1. What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?

Zero-Knowledge Proofs is a mechanism where an entity can cryptographically proof a statement to another withour reveling anything about that statement.

2. What are the principles of soundness, completeness, and zero-knowledge?

Soundness: The prover can't cheat the verify if the statement is not valid.
Completeness: An honest prover will eventually convince the verify about the validity of the statment.
ZK: The verifier learns nothing about the statement besides the fact it's true.

3. What distinguishes interactive from non-interactive proofs?

While in interactive proofs we need a back a forth communication between the prover and the verifier, in non-interactive proofs the verifier can convince itself about the validity of the statement.

**ðŸ¤” Consider the following:**
1. Which example did you find most enlightening, and why?

Sudoku. Because is a real world example of the applied concepts of ZK.

2. How do these examples demonstrate the principles of zero-knowledge proofs?

Waldo: The verifier can see Waldo but not to where he is. That's means the prover statement is valid and the verifier learns nothing about the location.

3. Can you think of any potential applications of these concepts in everyday life?

Authentication. We log-in to many online applications everyday which ask you for personal details.

4. Can you explain these thought experiments to someone non-technical? Try it with a friend or family member!

**ðŸ¤” Consider the following:**
1. Which application of ZKP do you find most intriguing, and why?

MACI: Wonder how and when this mechanism can be applied to off-chain votings

2. Can you imagine any other potential applications of ZKP?

Continuous ZK face recognition to proof identity. When an ID is stolen, this will prove that the actual user is the same as the ID claims.
